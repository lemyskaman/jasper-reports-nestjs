# Jasper Reports NestJS API

A modular, production-ready NestJS backend for uploading, storing, and processing JasperReports (`.jrxml` and `.jasper` files) and managing a products table in PostgreSQL. The project uses a clean hexagonal architecture, vertical slice modularity, and is fully Dockerized for easy local and production deployment.

## Dependency Installation

- Node.js 18+ and npm required for local development
- Docker and Docker Compose required for containerized setup

Install Node dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

## Project Installation & Usage

### Local Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the app:
   ```sh
   npm run start:dev
   ```
3. (Optional) Seed the database:
   ```sh
   npm run seed
   ```
4. Access Swagger UI: [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)

### Dockerized (Recommended)
1. Build and start all services:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
2. (Optional) Seed the database:
   ```sh
   docker compose exec app npm run seed
   ```
3. Access:
   - API: http://localhost:3000
   - Swagger: http://localhost:3000/api
   - pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050 (admin@admin.com / admin)

## Docker Files Explained

- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for production. Installs dependencies, builds the app, and runs it with Node.js. Also includes a Java stage for JasperReports integration.
- **Dockerfile.dev**: Development image. Installs Node.js, Java, and downloads JasperReports libraries for local testing and development.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Orchestrates the app, PostgreSQL, Jasper engine, and pgAdmin. Sets up volumes for persistence and mounts source code for live reload in development.

## Project Architecture

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Separates domain logic from infrastructure and application layers. Promotes testability and maintainability.
- **Vertical Slice Modularity**: Each feature (products, reports) is self-contained with its own controllers, DTOs, entities, and repositories.
- **TypeORM**: Used for database access and migrations.
- **Swagger**: Auto-generates API documentation from code and DTOs.

## Module Details

### Products Module
- **Purpose**: CRUD operations for products (name, price, description).
- **Entry Point**: `src/products/application/controllers/products.controller.ts`
- **Workflow**:
  - REST endpoints for listing and creating products.
  - Input validated with DTOs and class-validator.
  - Data persisted to PostgreSQL via TypeORM.
  - Seeder script (`npm run seed`) populates >1000 demo products.

### Reports Module
- **Purpose**: Upload, store, and (planned) process JasperReports files (`.jrxml`, `.jasper`).
- **Entry Point**: `src/reports/application/controllers/reports.controller.ts`
- **Workflow**:
  - REST endpoint for uploading report files.
  - Files stored in `/uploads` directory.
  - (Planned) Processing via Jasper engine container.
  - Input validated with DTOs and class-validator.

### Shared Infrastructure
- **Database**: TypeORM config and seeding logic (`src/shared/infrastructure/database/`).
- **Jasper**: Service stub for future JasperReports processing (`src/shared/infrastructure/jasper/`).
- **Storage**: Service for file management (`src/shared/infrastructure/storage/`).

## Jasper Module & Engine

- **Jasper Module Location:** `src/shared/infrastructure/jasper/`
- **Service:** `jasper.service.ts` (stub for future JasperReports integration)
- **Purpose:** Intended to provide methods for interacting with the JasperReports Java engine, such as compiling `.jrxml` files, filling reports with data, and exporting to PDF or other formats.
- **Engine Integration:**
  - The Docker setup includes a `jasper` service (see `docker-compose.yml`) that runs an OpenJDK container, ready for future integration with the JasperReports engine.
  - The development Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.dev`) downloads JasperReports JARs and dependencies, preparing the environment for Java-based report processing.
- **Current State:**
  - The NestJS backend currently allows uploading and storing `.jrxml` and `.jasper` files.
  - The actual report processing (compiling, filling, exporting) is planned for future implementation, leveraging the Java engine container and the service stub.
- **Planned Workflow:**
  1. User uploads a report file via the API.
  2. The backend stores the file and (in the future) will call the Jasper service to process it using the Java engine.
  3. The processed output (e.g., PDF) will be returned or stored for download.


## API Documentation

- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)
- Endpoints grouped by module (products, reports)

## Functionalities

- **Products Module:** Full CRUD for products (name, price, description) with DTO validation, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL. Includes a seeder for >1000 demo records.
- **Reports Module:** Upload and store `.jrxml` and `.jasper` files, with endpoints for upload and (via JasperService) PDF processing. Files are validated and stored in `/uploads`.
- **Jasper Integration:** Java-based JasperReports engine is integrated via Docker and a CLI, allowing real report processing from the API.
- **Swagger:** Modular, grouped API docs at `/api`.
- **Hexagonal Architecture:** Each feature is a vertical slice with its own controllers, DTOs, entities, and repositories. Shared infrastructure is cleanly separated.

## Testing

### Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests:** For all repositories, services, and controllers using `@nestjs/testing` and provider overrides. All logic is type-safe and fully covered.
- **E2E Tests:** For all endpoints and workflows, using NestJS best practices (`supertest` default import, `INestApplication`, and real HTTP requests).
- **Coverage:** All tests run in Docker and CI. Coverage is measured with Jest.

### How to Run Tests

**Unit & E2E (all):**
```sh
docker compose run --rm app npm test -- --coverage --config ./jest.config.js
```

**E2E only (NestJS idiomatic):**
```sh
docker compose run --rm app npm run test:e2e
```

### Coverage

- **Current overall coverage:**  
   - **Statements:** ~80%
   - **Branches:** ~23%
   - **Functions:** ~78%
   - **Lines:** ~77%
- **All core modules and endpoints are covered by both unit and E2E tests.**
- **Coverage is measured in Docker, so results reflect real deployment/test environments.**
